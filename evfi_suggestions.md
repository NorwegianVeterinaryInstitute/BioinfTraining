## For course:

- configuration usb and optical drive + exchange folder



## ? Before the course - for new beginners under unix/linux, or if they need those tool to start with their work before the course? 
can be difficult if no guidance to learn (so many different tools) - those ones are pretty efficient :)

Maybe some students may have long to wait before beeing able to take the course: so I guess they could benefit from being able to follow independent parts...
> would only be a repeat afterwards

- Can provide links to start with [the-unix-workbench] if insterested (very easy to follow)  and links to [shell] from swcarpentry you provide within the course

[the-unix-workbench]:https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/

[shell]:http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

- link to learn github - encourage to learn how to collaborate with other-students (ie taking notes and sharing with each others) using also markdown


### Maybe some videos: links checked and were easy (easier to watch video when brain do not want to understand any reading anymore)
