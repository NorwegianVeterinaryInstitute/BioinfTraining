# Non - metric multidimensional scaling : NMDS

## What is that?
**A dimension reduction method:**
- attempts to represent objects as closely as posible in a low-multidimensional space =
find few dimensions that represent most part of the objects (concept alike Single Value Decomposition, from which
PCA: Principal component analysis is a special case).

This means finding variables/parameters that explain most of your object

[Dimentionality reduction wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)


- indirect gradient analysis
- ordination (order -> hierarchical) based on distance/dissimilarity matrix
