# Non - metric multidimensional scaling : NMDS
Not a cluster analysis? or? . But partitioning variation.

## What is that?
**A dimension reduction method:**
- attempts to represent objects as closely as posible in a low-multidimensional space =
find few dimensions that represent most part of the objects (concept alike Single Value Decomposition, from which
PCA: Principal component analysis is a special case).

This means finding variables/parameters that explain most of your object

[Dimentionality reduction wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)


- indirect gradient analysis
- ordination (order -> hierarchical) based on distance/dissimilarity matrix
- rank-based approach (substitution distance by ranks) -> loose magnitude distances

- usable with quantitative/qualitative or mixed variables
- all type distances matrices (all units)

**stress values** should always be mentionned
  - [ ] what are they?
