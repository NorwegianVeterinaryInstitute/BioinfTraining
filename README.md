# Bioinformatics training at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute


## Purpose
At the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, we are now starting an internal course in bioinformatics. This
repo will contain information, documentation, tutorials etc for this course.


## Instructors

The instructors are:

  * Karin Lagesen - comparative genomics and main organizer
  * Arvind Sundaram - transcriptomics
  * Thomas Haverkamp - metagenomics

## Practical information

# Small how-tos for various processes

  * [Use of mash](mash.md)
  * [Use of conda](conda.md)
  * [Mapping and visualization](assembly_visualization.md)


## Course pages

We have created specific pages for each part of the course.

  * [Common introduction](introduction.md)
  * [Technical tricks and hits](techstuff.md)
  * [Comparative genomics](compgenomics.md)
  * [Metagenomics](metagenomics.md)
  * [Transcriptomics](transcriptomics.md)

### Messages

We will keep an archive of outgoing practical messages, like homework etc,
[on this webpage](messages.md). Note, some information might be redacted for
information security reasons.

### Etherpad

An Etherpad is a collaborative document where all can write down notes,
tips, hints, links etc. Please note, this document is public, and hence,
you should not write anything there that you wouldn't talk about on
the bus on your way to work!

### Computers

All participants will be handed a laptop with Virtualbox installed. All
participants are expected to handle this laptop with care, and to ensure that
nobody gets access to it. This laptop is yours for the duration. You have admin
on this computer, but don't take this to mean that you can install whatever you
want. Last but not least, this computer should only be used on the wireless
network at the Institute, and should not be plugged in the wall.

Please note: do not keep data on this laptop that you cannot afford to lose.
This laptop is not a storage device - this is a tool used for processing data,
not for storing it.

### Virtualbox
The main reason you are given a separate computer to work on is because we
will be using the software called Virtualbox. This is software that we are not
allowed to use on computers connected to the network at the Institute.

Virtualbox is a program that enables you to have a computer running virtually
inside your computer. You will "install" a specific version of linux inside
virtualbox. This is what we will use to interface with the cluster that we will
use for processing the data.

### Abel
We will use the University of Oslo's High Performance Computing cluster for
most of our work. For more about how Abel works. see here.

Please note: transfer and storage of data on abel is only allowed with prior
approval by Karin.

You can find out more about [how to use abel here.](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/Info/wiki)
