#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=DontKillMe
#SBATCH --account=nn9305k
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=32G

## Set up job environment:
source /cluster/bin/jobsetup

conda activate SeqSero_Shared
python /work/projects/nn9305k/src/SeqSero/SeqSero/SeqSero.py -m "1" -i input_file -b "mem"
conda deactivate 
```
