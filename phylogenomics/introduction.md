# Preampule
We will present here different methods of making **"not wrong trees"**. 

We will focus on tree reconstruction based on characters
(as many of you already have some experience with making trees based on distance)

Some methods and steps are shared between the different models used to reconstruct trees (ie. matrices models of 
character changes, robustness evaluation).

I choose to embed the description of those shared method in each document describing the tree building method 
- so you can have an overview of all steps for each tree building method independently.
This means that you will have the complete information for each method (without the need to look at the other method). 

Those common parts will be delimited with [?? icone]

But if you are curious and look at different methods: then some parts will be totally identical.

I will heavily rely on worflows, so we can recover the logical and chronological steps of what we have to pay attention to.
