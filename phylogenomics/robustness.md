Robustness inference is necessary to give us an indication of:
- how much we can believe into the infered general tree topology
- evaluate if some nodes are robust while others are not

Why some parts can be robust while others not?
- different evolution histories of some compartiments in your genome (ie: some genes
evolving faster than other: some genes acquired by horizontal transfer, some parts of genes
more strongly selected than others - think of steems and loops for RNAs)

Resampling: columns (character position for each OTU in your multiple alignement)

![Robustess inference]

# non-parametric test -> non statistical (non model based)

## Bootstraping = Resampling with replacement

## Jackniffing = resampling without replacement

# parametric test -> statistical ()
