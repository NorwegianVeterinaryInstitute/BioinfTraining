# Rate of Heterogeneity
Part 2 (optional of your model).

Non uniform rate evolution of characters at the different positions <=>
Unequal site specific changes

- NB: - codons :
 - 3d position: easily saturated (only good with shallow phylogenies - recent evolution)
 - 2d position stable -> natural selection
 - 1st position -> in the middle
 > that I did not get why 1 less stable than 2 ...2 has some redundancy so partially neutra.

Require Heterogeneity correction. Assume amount of change at position in relation to number of position changing. **Modeled by a GAMA distribution - with shape parameter shape ALPHA - represents the distribution of number of changes per site

! [fig] nb site changing / amount of change

```
maybe try to simulate with R _ then will be as well a small R course :)

```
Shape parameter prior : either "experience" or estimated from the data (time consuming)

Reading the distribution with different shapes:
- the bell_ moderate, equal rate - for a few position more changes
- decreasing fast -> - [ ] whats the name of this shape already ? - most sites: very little changes, a few sites many (common in DNA)
- line : all changes in a small number of sites


- [Â ] checks : rate classes increase: no one rate is over represented
